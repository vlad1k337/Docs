import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

<Callout title="Prerequisites" type="info">
  Ensure that three odometry pods are connected: two that are parallel to the length
  of your chassis and another that is perpendicular to your chassis length. These should be plugged
  into ports that have motors on them preferably. Due to technical limitations on REV hubs, encoder ports
  0 and 3 are the fastest and are recommended for the two parallel pods.
</Callout>

## Setup

In `Constants.java`, add an instance of `ThreeWheelIMUConstants`. Make sure to replace the hardware map names
with the actual names of the motor port they are plugged into. You must also set the IMU orientation to match the orientation of your Control Hub.

```java title="Constants.java"
public static ThreeWheelIMUConstants localizerConstants = new ThreeWheelIMUConstants()
            .forwardTicksToInches(.001989436789)
            .strafeTicksToInches(.001989436789)
            .turnTicksToInches(.001989436789)
            .leftPodY(1)
            .rightPodY(-1)
            .strafePodX(-2.5)
            .leftEncoder_HardwareMapName("leftFront")
            .rightEncoder_HardwareMapName("rightRear")
            .strafeEncoder_HardwareMapName("rightFront")
            .leftEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD)
            .rightEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD)
            .strafeEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD)
            .IMU_HardwareMapName("imu")
            .IMU_Orientation(new RevHubOrientationOnRobot(RevHubOrientationOnRobot.LogoFacingDirection.UP, RevHubOrientationOnRobot.UsbFacingDirection.LEFT));
```

Then, add `.threeWheelIMULocalizer` to `createFollower`:

```java title="Constants.java"
return new FollowerBuilder(followerConstants, hardwareMap)
    .threeWheelIMULocalizer(localizerConstants)
    /* other builder steps */
    .build();
```

### Offsets

You must also set your odometry pod offsets, which is where they are
relative to your robot's center of rotation. You can use the diagram below
to find them. **Offsets are in inches.**

<img
  className="hidden dark:inline-block"
  src="/docs/odometry-dark.png"
  alt="Odometry Pod Offset Diagram"
/>

Once you have found your offsets, add them to your localizer constants by
using `.leftPodY()`, `.rightPodY()` and `.strafePodX()`.

## Encoder Directions

We will now determine the encoder directions. First, select and run
localization test under the localization folder in the tuning OpMode. Then,
move the robot forward. The x coordinate should increase. Next, move the
robot left. The y coordinate should increase. If either of those does not
happen, you must reverse the respective encoder. To reverse an encoder, add

To reverse an encoder, add one of the following to `ThreeWheelIMUConstants`:

```java title="Constants.java"
.leftEncoderDirection(Encoder.REVERSE)
.rightEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD)

// and/or:

.strafeEncoderDirection(Encoder.REVERSE)
```

<Callout title="Important" type="warning">
  If when you push the robot forward both x and y change, it is likely that either your offsets have the wrong sign,
  or that the hardwareMap is incorrect (ie. forward encoder is actually your strafe encoder and vise versa)
</Callout>

## Forward Tuner

We will now adjust multipliers that convert encoder ticks into real-world
measurements: inches. This ensures your localizer's readings are accurate.

In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the forward tuner.
Then, push the robot **forward 48 inches** (exactly 2 field tiles). This
distance is configurable if needed. Once you push the robot forward, two
numbers will be displayed on telemetry:

- The distance the robot thinks it has traveled
- The multiplier; this is the number you want.

Add the multiplier to your `ThreeWheelIMUConstants` by adding the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.forwardTicksToInches(multiplier)
```

<Callout title="Tip" type="info">
  It is recommended that you run these tests multiple times and average the results,
  as it can result in more accurate localization.
</Callout>

## Lateral Tuner

The lateral tuner is very similar to the forward tuner, except it is
sideways. In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the
lateral tuner. Push the robot **left 48 inches** (exactly 2 field tiles). As
with the forward tuner, this distance is configurable.

Lastly, add the multiplier to `ThreeWheelIMUConstants` by adding the following line.

```java title="Constants.java"
.strafeTicksToInches(multiplier)
```

## Turn Tuner

The turn tuner is similar to both the forward tuner and lateral tuner, except it is
rotational. Place the robot so it aligns to a fixed reference point (e.g., edge of a field tile).
In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the
lateral tuner. Rotate the robot **counterclockwise one full rotation**. As
with the previous tuners, this amount is configurable.

Lastly, add the multiplier to `ThreeWheelIMUConstants` by adding the following line.

```java title="Constants.java"
.turnTicksToInches(multiplier)
```

## Testing the localizer

Once you have completed the tuning steps, you can test your localizer as
described
[on the localization page](/docs/pathing/tuning/localization#localization-test).

Congratulations on successfully tuning your localizer!

<Callout title="Note on ESD" type="warning">
    If you robot seems to:

    1. Turn or face a different direction when starting a path
    2. Turn to a incorrect angle or miss with large, unfixable errors

    Your robot's IMU might be affected by ESD (electrostatic discharge). Consider grounding
    the robot with a [grounding strap](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1269/) and/or 
    [reading this guide from FIRST to understand ESD](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/managing_esd/managing-esd.html)

    If after the above you cannot fix the issue, [switch to the non-IMU ThreeWheel Localizer](/docs/pathing/tuning/localization/three-wheel), as
    it will be significantly more accurate than an interfered IMU.
