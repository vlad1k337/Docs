Pedro Pathing uses a right-hand coordinate system, which is nonstandard to the FTC SDK Standard.

As shown, as a robot moves to the right in the image below, x increases. As a robot moves up on the field image, y increases.  

A robot facing towards the right side of the image is at a heading of 0 radians (0 degrees), facing up is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians (90 degrees), facing left is $\pi$ radians (180 degrees), and facing down is $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ radians (270 degrees).
Thus, counterclockwise rotation is positive rotation, similar to a unit circle.

To convert FTC Coordinates for the Decode game into Pedro's coordinates, first declare a Pose in FTC coordinates (inverted for decode). Let's say you have Pose2D (a class in the FTC SDK) `ftcPose2d` with your coordinates from a camera. You can use 
`Pose ftcStandard = PoseConverter.pose2DToPose(ftcPose2d, InvertedFTCCoordinates.INSTANCE);` to convert this to Pedro's `Pose` class. Then, you need to convert to Pedro coordinates using 
`ftcStandard.getAsCoordinateSystem(PedroCoordinates.INSTANCE);`
